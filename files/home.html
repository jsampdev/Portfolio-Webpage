              &emsp;Hello! My name is Jack Sample, a software engineer studying at
              Clarkson University. I hope to specialize in UI/UX environments
              and full stack web development!
              <br />
              &emsp;I am currently employed as a Web Development Intern at Interactive
              Media Consulting (IMC) in Saratoga Springs, New York. During this
              experience I am learning about web design projects through
              Wordpress using Divi tools and other powerful plugins.

            &emsp;"I had the opportunity to teach Jack in the software engineering course (EE368) in the 2023 spring semester. Please note that this course is part of our 
            NSF IUSE grant and its focus is to promote the project-based learning in undergraduate software engineering courses. This highly technical, project-oriented 
            course teaches my students how to participate in managing and executing the process of carrying out a significant software development effort from a conceptual 
            idea of new features through integration and testing of the entire feature working on an existing product, and Jack was the top student in this course and 
            demonstrated excellent ability in this field. He also demonstrated his excellent ability of programming in PHP and web template such as Mustache through the course project."

            &emsp;"Jack is a great young man.  Just to give you a bit of context, I’ve known him since he was born. His mother and I have been close friends since we were in Kindergarten,
            so I’ve been there for the good and the challenging times. I’m happy to say that there have not been many challenging times with Jack. He’s a bright kid and a very hard worker. 
            He cares deeply about people’s good opinion, so he’s eager to exceed expectations. He’s respectful and personable, which makes him relate well to strangers and peers. He’s eager to learn and takes constructive criticism well.  
            Jack is serious about his goals and is not distracted by the extracurriculars that many of his peers are. He doesn’t party or get caught up in drama, so he’ll be dependable and will be at work on time and capable of doing his best."
