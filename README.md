### Portfolio-Webpage

### ‚ùìWhy a Portfolio Webpage?
I created this portfolio page using only HTML and CSS to demonstrate my design skills that I learned from my Udemy course, The Complete Web Developer, as well as the skills obtained from my internship at IMC.
This website will be a way for employers/collaborators to learn more about me and what I have accomplished.
If you have a moment, please peruse through the code I have uploaded and let me know what you think! Feedback both positive and negative are priceless.
